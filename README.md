#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

    Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from early stages of system specification to maintanance when its in use

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

    The birth of software engineering in the 1960s where IBM develped FORTRAN the first modern compiler
    
    The rise of methodologies and operating systems in the 1970s where the waterfall model,
    C programming language and UNIX were introduced

    Energence of cloud computing and AI recently through docker which popularized containers for software deployment and the use of AI has gained popularity where it has been intergrated into various sectors such as healthcare and robotics 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    Software specification, where cutomers and engeneers define software that is to be produced

    Software development, where software is designed and programmed

    Software validation, software checked to ensure that its what the customer requries

    Software evolution, where software is modified to reflectchanging demands of customer

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

    The Waterfall methodology is a plan-driven model with separate and distict phases of specification and development while the Algile process is incremental, specification development and validation occurs concurrently which makes it easier to change the process to reflect changes of the customer


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    Software engineer work on designing developing testing and maintaining code

    Quality assurance engineer ensure that software meets quality standards such as  testing for bugs performance issues and security vulnebilities

    Project manager oversees software development ensuring they are complited ontime within scope and within the budget, they also coordinate teams and manage risks

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    IDEs makes coding easier as the give functionality such as intellisense and make it easer to write debug and run code which saves time an example is visual studio code and pycharm, Version control systems allow one to track changes made to their code and give the ability to revert back to pervious versions if bugs occure an example is git and github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

    Debugging complex code can be time consuming which can be made easier using debugging tools such as visual studio debuggers and writting unit tests to catch bugs early
    
    Keeping up with changing technology such as new frameworks and programming languages, one can solve this issue by following tech blogs and participating in coding comminities

    Balancing scalability and performance solved by optimizing database queries and use of indexing

    Meeting deadlines and managing workload can also be a barden which can be eased by using agile methodologies and breaking tasks into smaller achievable goals

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit testing is were individual components are tested independently its importance is in catching bugs early

    Intergration testing is the testing of interaction between modules and components and is important in detecting interface issues between modules

    System testing tests the system as a whole and helps validate overall system behavior

    Acceptance testing is testing customer's data to see if the system meets the client's needs and it confirms readiness for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    The study of writting prompts -inputs to a large language model- in a refined way so as to get the best outputs from the models


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

    Vague - Write code to add two numbers

    Improved - Explain to me the use of functions by writing code in javascript that adds two numbers and returns the output
